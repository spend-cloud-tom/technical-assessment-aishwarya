# Tech assessment 
## For the role of Software Engineer at Visma | ProActive

This repository contains an install of [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) with a simple layout and a few pages. It also has a couple of modules installed. There's one module that connects to the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/).

The goal of this assessment is to evaluate your skills in software development. We are looking for a candidate that can write clean, maintainable code and has a good understanding of the technologies used in this project.

Please don't spend more than 4 hours on this assessment. We are not looking for a perfect solution, but we want to see how you approach the problem and how you solve it. If you don't have time to finish all the tasks, that's fine. Just submit what you have done.

## Task

Connect to an additional API: the Rick and Morty API. Display a list of characters from the Rick and Morty universe. The list should be displayed in a new page, `/rick-and-morty`. Each character should be displayed with their name, species, and an image. When clicking on a character, the user should be taken to a new page, `/rick-and-morty/:id`, where they can see more details about the character.

## Character list feature specs

- Display a list of characters
- Allow users to toggle betweeen a grid and list view

## Bonus points

- Add a search bar to filter characters by name
- Add automated tests (use Vitest)

## Submission

Please submit your solution as a pull request to this repository. The PR should include a description of the changes you made and how to run the project locally.

Good luck! 🚀
